<H4>The Use of a Learner-Designed Course to Improve the Knowledge and Self-Reported Competence of Transitioning Senior Internal Medicine Residents in Cardiology</H4>


<div class="heading">(A) Background Information:</div>
You are being invited to participate in a research study directed by Dr. DeJong to identify if a peer-designed course including simulation improves the self-reported confidence of Internal Medicine residents in Cardiology. Dr. DeJong or one of her research staff will be available to answer any questions you may have. This study is sponsored by Queen’s University and has been approved by the Queen’s University Health Sciences and Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board.
<br>
<div class="heading">(B) Aim of the Study:</div>
The purpose of the study is to determine if a learner-designed course including simulation improves the knowledge and self-reported confidence of new senior Internal Medicine residents required to cross-cover the Cardiology service. 
<br>
<div class="heading">(C) Description of involvement:</div>
You are asked to complete a short survey on self-rated confidence with various cardiology topics as well as a short knowledge assessment test.  This will be repeated after the CSU bootcamp course, and at 3 months after completion of the course.  Your responses will be anonymous. You may be asked to sign this consent form more than once, as we have no way of knowing who has signed in in the past. 
<br>
<div class="heading">(D) Risks/Side-Effects: </div>
Participation in this study has no effect on evaluation. Data was collected anonymously and participation and signing of the consent form is voluntary.
<br>
<div class="heading">(E) Benefits: </div>
No direct individual benefit. There is potential for improvement of internal medicine residency education in future years.
<br>
<div class="heading">(F) Exclusions: </div>
There are no specific exclusion criteria for first year residents transitioning into the senior role. 
<br>
<div class="heading">(G) Confidentiality: </div>
All information obtained during the course of this study is strictly confidential and your anonymity will be protected.  Information collected during this study will be used in analysis and then will be published in journals and presented at meetings to the medical/scientific community.  However, you will not be identified in any publication or reports. 
<br>
<div class="heading">(H) Voluntary nature of study/Freedom to withdraw or participate: </div>
Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You may withdraw from this study at any time and your withdrawal will not affect your evaluation in residency in any way. 
<br>
<div class="heading">(I) Withdrawal of participant by principal investigator: </div>
There are no specific withdrawal criteria.
